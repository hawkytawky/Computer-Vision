# Computer-Vision

This repository focuses on the assignments in the Computer Vision module at The University of Melbourne in semester 2. 

From self-driving cars to automatic processing of medical scans, vision is a key sensory modality for a variety of artificial intelligence tasks. However, extracting meaning from images poses various computational challenges. This subject deals with learning the basic principles of image formation and computational methods for interpreting images. It develops an understanding of the standard frameworks used in computer vision algorithms and their applications in tasks such as object recognition, target detection, and three-dimensional reconstruction. The programming language used is Python.

Topics covered may include:
* Basics of image formation
* Illumination and reflectance models
* Colour spaces
* Feature detectors and descriptors
* Stereo correspondence
* Methods for recovering three-dimensional shape
* Image segmentation
* Categorical and instance-level recognition
